<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Pieter du Plessis. I am a 52 year old male from South Africa. I have always had an interest for software or web development, but was very skeptical to start learning about it.</p>

<p>I have always worked in an industry that I don't really enjoy, in actual fact I was miserable in what I was doing. I spoke to my wife about it, and with the love and support she always gives me, she told me just to do it. She said."What do you have to loose. Knowledge is power and you will love what you are doing. You have nothing to loose."</p>

<p>I then started you search the web, and could not believe how expensive it is to study towards something you love.I found the The complete 2024 web development bootcamp from Dr. Angela Yui. This is where it all stared. The course was really well structured, teaching you everything from scratch.I am really happy I took this leap of Faith, with the tremendous support of my wife to study towards what I enjoy and love every moment of it.I guess you are never to old to teach an old dog new tricks.</p>
